# Project-3
Data Visualization - Manuela, Victoria, Pamela, Sergio, Ricky

Our summarized efforts for ethical considerations made in the project:
- Firstly, we are trusting that the creator of the dataset obtained the information credibly and that it was obtained straight from Spotify as listed in the provenance on Kaggle.
- Our data soley relies on Spotify which excludes people who do not have access to the platform or who choose to use different streaming platforms.
- We are not sure how Spotify determines their rankings of songs and the metrics the songs are given.
- Even though we can conclude global observations, the data is only from 73 countries and would exclude other countries around the world.
